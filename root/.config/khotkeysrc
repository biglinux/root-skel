Comment=Leia o coment\xc3\xa1rio sobre a a\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o "Digitar 'Hello'" primeiro.\n\nO Qt Designer usa Ctrl+F4 para fechar as janelas. No KDE, entretanto, o Ctrl+F4 \xc3\xa9 o atalho para ir \xc3\xa0 \xc3\xa1rea de trabalho virtual 4 e, por isto, o atalho n\xc3\xa3o funciona no Qt Designer. Al\xc3\xa9m disso, o Qt Designer n\xc3\xa3o usa o Ctrl+W padr\xc3\xa3o do KDE para fechar a janela.\n\nEste problema pode ser resolvido com o remapeamento do Ctrl+W para Ctrl+F4 quando a janela ativa for o Qt Designer. Quando o Qt Designer est\xc3\xa1 ativo, toda vez que Ctrl+W \xc3\xa9 pressionado, Ctrl+F4 ser\xc3\xa1 enviado alternativamente para o Qt Designer. Em outros aplicativos, o efeito do Ctrl+W \xc3\xa9 inalterado.\n\nAgora precisamos especificar tr\xc3\xaas coisas: Um novo atalho de ativa\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o para o 'Ctrl+W', uma nova a\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de entrada do teclado que envia o Ctrl+F4, e uma nova condi\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o de que a janela ativa \xc3\xa9 o Qt Designer.\nO Qt Designer parece sempre ter o t\xc3\xadtulo 'Qt Designer by Trolltech' e, por isto, a condi\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o ir\xc3\xa1 checar se a janela ativa tem aquele t\xc3\xadtulo.

Comment=O Konqueror no KDE3.1 tem abas, e agora voc\xc3\xaa tamb\xc3\xa9m pode ter gestos.\n\nApenas pressione o bot\xc3\xa3o do meio do mouse e comece a desenhar um dos gestos, e ap\xc3\xb3s voc\xc3\xaa ter terminado, solte o bot\xc3\xa3o do mouse. Se voc\xc3\xaa apenas precisa colar a sele\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o, isto ainda funciona, apenas clique com o bot\xc3\xa3o do meio do mouse. (Voc\xc3\xaa pode trocar o bot\xc3\xa3o do mouse a usar nas configura\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb5es globais).\n\nAt\xc3\xa9 o momento, existem os seguintes gestos dispon\xc3\xadveis:\nmover para a direita e voltar para a esquerda - Avan\xc3\xa7ar (Alt+seta direita)\nmover para a esquerda e voltar para a direita - Retroceder (Alt+seta esquerda)\nmover para cima e voltar para baixo - Subir (Alt+seta para cima)\ngirar no sentido anti-hor\xc3\xa1rio - Recarregar (F5)\n\nAs formas dos gestos podem ser indicadas executando-as no di\xc3\xa1logo de configura\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o. Voc\xc3\xaa tamb\xc3\xa9m pode olhar o seu teclado num\xc3\xa9rico para ajud\xc3\xa1-lo, gestos s\xc3\xa3o reconhecidos como uma grade de 3x3 campos, numerados de 1 a 9.\n\nObserve que voc\xc3\xaa precisa executar o gesto de forma exata para disparar a a\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o. Por isso, \xc3\xa9 poss\xc3\xadvel indicar mais gestos para a a\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o. Tente evitar gestos complicados onde voc\xc3\xaa troca a dire\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o do movimento do mouse mais de uma vez. Por exemplo, 45654 ou 74123 s\xc3\xa3o simples de efetuar, mas 1236987 pode ser relativamente dif\xc3\xadcil.\n\nAs condi\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb5es para todos os gestos est\xc3\xa3o definidas neste grupo. Todos estes gestos est\xc3\xa3o ativos apenas se a janela ativa \xc3\xa9 o Konqueror (a classe cont\xc3\xa9m 'konqueror').
